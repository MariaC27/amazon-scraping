I didn't think there were many other alternatives outside of those that would be drastically different.That was until I had an opportunity to try these WonderBelly Antacid tablets. The packaging is very cute, and the flavor is even better! As someone who suffers from chronic heartburn, these have become my new best friends.Not only do they taste and look great, but they also work. I can see no difference between these and Tums. Actually, now that I think about it, I find myself usually only taking 2 Wonderbelly tablets vs. my normal dose of 4 Tums tablets.If you also suffer from chronic heartburn, do yourself a favor and give these a try for yourself!",

I'm glad I did, these tablets smell pleasant but the taste was subtle and not chalky. If you don't chew the tablets they last a while in your mouth. If you do chew them, it doesn't get stuck to your teeth as much. Does what it's supposed to. I like that there is a variety of flavors and you can pick the flavor you like instead of getting stuck with variety bottle.",

The company has other items as well that they advertise as being better options because of better ingredients.  They come in a large tin container with 120 tablets.  The tablets don't seem as chalky as the other stuff.  They were completely pleasurable to chew and worked as well as other antiacids do for me.  The active ingredient is the same.

At least I would know the taste and even if they make you feel nauseous if taken when not necessarily to test out.  I've taken others in the past that actually make me feel worse so I figure if it does not make me sick when I do not need it them it will certainly not do so when I do.At this time I can say that it tastes fine and it did not make me feel off.  My mom on the other hand, was suffering from some indigestion after eating a few too many sweet and sour shrimp and she took one.  She said it is not something she can chew because the taste and texture were not her favorite.  However, she said if she breaks it into pieces and swallows it as you would aspirin then she's fine with that and that it did in fact ease her discomfort quite quickly.So from 2 people testing this out in the same house: we recommend!  Not to mention $19.99 for 120 tablets is quite a great price!",

I do wish these came in a small bag or something instead of the tin, because I'm just going to end up throwing the tin away.

So I waited to try these or see how effective they were. They have the chew of a typical antacid tablet not chalky just the same consistancy. The flavor is strawberry milkshake but I'm not sure if I'd necessarily call it that. They do have a creamy strawberry flavor and quite good to be honest but it well doesn't remind ME so much of a strawberry milkshake I guess. I took two tablets after I started having issues with the ghost of my taco hotdish kicking in. They worked great on the first dose. So two thumbs up there as with my regular antacid I sometimes find myself taking a second dose or two tablets. I'm happy with these not only how they work but they taste better than the chalky wintergreen flavor or mint flavor of what I typically buy. I tried fruit flavored types but in the past but didn't find them to my liking like these.",

It is a mild taste, although I can still tell it's antacid, it is more tolerable.  This product comes in a tin canister, about 120 tablets, all in strawberry milkshake flavor.  I think the strawberry flavor makes it more tolerable and less like antacid/medicine as opposed to lemon or mint flavors.

I was concerned about the flavor being lemon sorbet because I thought an acidic flavor when you have heartburn already was a terrible idea but honestly its great.  It doesn't taste acidic but rather a nice light lemon burst.  It is quite enjoyable.  You get 3 tablets in each pack of 20 but I have found that only 1 tablet seems to do the job if you are only experience light symptoms.  I will definitely considering reordering these for years to come.  They are a bit pricey though and that would be my main concern.

I was startled by the can--am not sure it will recycle with the aluminum beverage cans at my recycling center, but I guess if you aren't using plastic then it's glass or tin.

First off, the canister these tablets come in is very nice, and I like the little card included, which explains about the product and their mission as a company. The flavor of these tablets is fantastic! I was a little disappointed to see that you had to take multiple of them potentially for it to work properly.

I am all for clean antacids without the Talc and other junk but it makes no sense economically to continue to get this brand when it's now the same cost as my previous brand.  Sorry Wonderbelly.

They typically offer a range of fruity flavors that make them quite palatable, akin to Smarties candy.Enter Wonder Belly Antacid, boasting a formula free from talc, dyes, parabens, and artificial sweeteners. Intrigued by its health-conscious composition, I eagerly tried it, only to find the taste falling short of expectations.Despite my initial excitement for its purported health benefits, the taste of Wonder Belly Antacid left much to be desired. While I value natural ingredients, the flavor didn't quite hit the mark for me. Nonetheless, prioritizing health over taste, I'm inclined to continue consuming it.Additionally, I observed that the product comes in an aluminum bottle, packaged within a small cardboard box. While I appreciate the effort to minimize harmful ingredients, I couldn't help but feel the cardboard packaging was unnecessary and wasteful.In summary, Wonder Belly Antacid presents a health-conscious option for managing acid reflux, but its taste may not appeal to everyone. While I commend its natural formulation, improvements could be made in flavor and packaging efficiency.",

I'm all for less crud in the stuff we ingest.My husband had heartburn that evening. He took a few of these and unfortunately said they don't work as well as the brand he normally takes. With it also being more expensive it won't be something we end up picking up again.",

He usually gets Tums or the store brand version, and I don’t like these when I find myself needing some.The Wonderbelly antacids are much less chalky in the mouth than the tums or their generic versions. Instructions state to let them sit in the mouth for a few seconds and that makes them easier to chew through. I much prefer the texture of these.I am also allergic to red food coloring and love that these have no food dyes.They also come in an aluminum can. Sticker seal on outside and a foil seal under the cap.One tab helps soothe the heartburn quickly.This strawberry milkshake flavor tastes like a strawberry milkshake, but I prefer the mint version because I miss that cooling sensation with this flavor.I think these are really pricey for regular antacid users because you’ll be going through them rather quickly, but if you are like me and you use them once in a blue moon then they are definitely worth it.To see the photos I attached more clearly, while on a computer right click and select ‘Open image in new tab’ for the full sized image.",

They are upfront about the fact the active ingredient is exactly the same as in many other antacid tablets. I used these and they work the same as the big name products, but I'm pretty sure if you frequently consume antacids, you are not going to shell out 4 times more per tablet than, say, Tums Naturals, which have the same amount of calcium carbonate and check off a couple of the same sales points as this product.They may be worth it if you are sensitive to any unnatural or unnecessary ingredients, like dyes or sweeteners, which some other brands may or may not contain. And they do come in cute aluminum cans, that probably have a greater chance of actually getting recycled than plastic containers. Then again, 180 of these tablets come in 3 containers versus 1 container for the same amount of the name brands (as of this writing, these only seem to be offered in 60 tablet cans).It's up to you. My 3 star rating is meant to indicate the pluses and minuses could go either way, depending on the shopper.",

You have to use all sorts of scissors and other implements, you usually hurt yourself in the process, and it takes an ungodly amount of time for very little reward. There was a ton of cardboard packaging on the outside of this product. And it all fit together like a Jenga game so it was hard to tell which pieces needed to be pulled out of which. The amount of product inside was minimal. And I just feel so guilty for making all of this go to the landfill. It's really really expensive and I wouldn't repurchase based on that factor alone. But the lack of environmentally friendly packaging makes a future purchase even less likely.",

That's 10x more than the cost of a similar number of 1000mg TUMS-brand tablets!  That's crazy!Aside from the price, everything else about these antacids is nice.  They have a nice strawberry flavor and quickly remedied my heartburn after eating too much pizza and sauce recently.  I definitely liked the product, but I didn't see any significant benefits of these antacids over TUMS or similar products.  There's nothing to justify the 10x price increase.  To me, that's offensive.  ONE STAR!  Sorry, Wonderbelly!  What were you thinking?!",

This has easily identifiable and limited ingredients that make this a clean option. The tablets taste okay, though don’t really speak to a mango smoothie flavor. They are easy to chew but I did find that they get caked in my teeth and leave an awkward texture in my mouth. These do help with bloating and gas discomfort, though I can’t say they are an effective as a pill form. The price point for this is comparable to what I’ve seen it at my local store. Overall, these are a good option for those who don’t like to take pills or those who have dietary restrictions, but the texture and limited potency does impact whether I would buy this again in the future.

The tablets are very dry and stick to your mouth. You really need water to get these down. The safety seal isn’t very safe. Instead of a seal that covers the entire inside of the bottle, there is just a single strip of metallic tape that runs down one side of the lid and can. You could easily lift the un-taped side of the can, tamper with the product, and re-seal it to make it look new. I really don’t like taking medicine this way. I would rather swallow pills than try to chew this dry, chalky, nearly flavorless tablet. Also, at $11.99 for one bottle, they are expensive for simethicone and calcium, which are very common.

Although most of  Wonderbelly's antacids are verifiably Clean Label Project Certified (checks for things like lead, purity), I don’t see this product listed at the Clean Label Project webpage (yet?). (In theory the CL Project certification *might*  be as good as GMP certified, even better in a sense, because it tests store bought product that is purchased anonymously, not samples provided by the company. And then they do spot checks periodically. Genius!) (Disclaimer: Just my uneducated opinion about the value of the testing).Quality: Unfortunately the unique safety seal on this is easily tampered with. I can lift it and replace it so that it looks like it did originally. Otherwise, this container includes 42 chewable simethicone tablets that each contain 125 mg of Simethicone, which is the same amount as Gas-Ex Extra strength. They recommend taking 1-3 tablets with symptoms. They have a strong vanilla/strawberry scent, and taste the same (not personally a fan).  They don't dissolve quickly as I chew, but are dry and become a damp clump that sticks to my teeth. The ingredients are said to be “Clean”.  They seem to work for me, bringing quick relief (simethicone is great).I was happy to see other folks enjoyed these, because although I love strawberry shortcake, these just didn't do it for me. They stuck to and filled in the crevices of my molars so that the taste lingered for a long time (I have lots of dental work, so maybe that's the issue?), but I love the \"Clean Label project\" quality verification idea and that some of Wonderbelly's products can be verified in that program!",

I don’t know why the flavor name “mango smoothie” made me think they would be less chalky. The flavor is mildly artificial mango but not very sweet. I think that’s good as the flavor fades quickly after eating them, because when your stomach is upset, the last thing you want is a lingering taste. We will see how they work when I really need them!",

                "content": "These chewable tablets are very chalky and gets all over your hands. They are big tablets compared to other brands. I do like that they do not have talc in them nor any dyes. Some of the tablets were broken but I actually liked that because If I just had small discomfort that day I just took a tiny piece. These do work to an extent, but if you have severe gas, you might need more than one. The jar is metal which I really loved because it was easy to take with me because I did not have to worry about them spilling out since they have a screw cap. I will say I did not care of the mango smoothie flavor, it tastes odd. It probably has to do with the 'natural flavors' in the ingredients list. I do like these but would love just a mint flavor.",
