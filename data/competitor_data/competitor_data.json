To me, the chewables with the hard-shells that look like big candies are more pleasant to chew and eat.  These are ok though.  A bit chalky but fairly smooth.  They aren't too soft, or too hard.  They are easy to bite into.They make zinc based antacids and they work better, but are more expensive.  My husband won't take anything that even looks like a pill, but he'll take one of these as needed, so I keep a bottle by the bed.They work but sometimes  heartburn might come back a hour or two later.  You can take more, but after all these years I know myself so I just take something stronger.  My husband will usually chew a couple more and get up and go drink milk.  That works for him.",

This is 14$ and lasts just over a month.Dissolving the soda in a cup of water is easy and I drink it down quickly. These are chalky like tums and stick in your teeth, giving you a crappy taste for quite a while.I still give this product 4 stars because it works really well and is easy to carry.

I've been having some acid reflux recently and needed something to quell it. The only reason that I had to give this 4 stars instead of 5 is because there's a slightly strange aftertaste. It's not really a bad taste, but it's weird. However, that being said, it's easy enough to wash down with just water. I'd rather have something with a slightly weird aftertaste that I can get to go away in like 2 seconds than something full of food coloring. I know some people are weird about textures, and this is slightly chalky of a texture when you chew it, but it wasn't enough to bother me. I mean, it is a chewable tablet, what else can you expect? Functionally, it worked wonderfully for me!  There was only one time that I even had to take a second one even though the directions start at 2 tablets. I will definitely buy these again!",

It is cheaper to order it through Whole Foods  but you have to have minimum orders with them too.  A couple of stores near me sell it, but again, often out of stock.  It is somewhat chalky in taste, but aren't they all?  However, I prefer that to having the taste covered up with fruity additives and dyes.

Was looking forward to the organic vanilla and berry flavors in the description as the flavor in most antacids is nasty. Sadly these have no taste whatsoever unless you count the taste of chalk. So what justification is there for the 14 dollar price tag? not much. Fortunately I need these so rarely that this one bottle should last several years. Unlikely to order again.",

                "content": "I have all kinds of gut issues and go through a TON of anti-acids, especially Tums and Pepto. I know people complain about the chalky taste of Tums, but I actually like them. I‚Äôve tried several varieties and off-brands and have never had an issue with the taste- until these. I can‚Äôt explain it, but these are really hard for me to choke down. The texture and taste are super unpleasant. I guess if you need dye-free or talc-free Tums, it is good that these exist, but I really can‚Äôt stomach them. I‚Äôve reached for them on a few occasions and I just can‚Äôt do it. Plus, they cost more than their less-natural, but WAY better-tasting competitors.  I wouldn‚Äôt take a risk on these if you haven‚Äôt tried them before- I now have a whole bottle I don‚Äôt know what to do with. :(",

I can't eat cookies or brownies either for that same reason:( I was anticipating a product that was bragging about being so healthy that they would not make it super sweet ...more so than candy....not the case.  I think kids would really like this in their trick-or-treating bags it's so sweet.  I'm going to have to throw them away and go back to my artificial crappy rolaids.  Not happy about this.  I wish they made plain unsweetened ones...I don't mind bland..in fact I prefer it.",

Turns out that is how it works , it foams up and forms a protective membrane in your stomach to prevent stomach acid from getting into your esophagus.

I mentioned that I occasionally use Tums & he said this was better. The original tastes worse than this cherry flavor but even the cherry flavor taste could be improved. That's why I only gave it 4 stars. As far as the problem of GERD and stuff in my throat, it is much better, especially in the morning which is the worse time for me. I really thought it was from sinus problem but I now can usually distinguish my sinus nose drip from my GERD",

It is the only antacid I've ever used that created a foam when you chew, and wasn't quite sure I liked that.  However, aside from using it once a day as my doctor prescribed, I have also used it when I had heartburn, and this is when I realized the purpose of the foam.  It just seems to settle right on top of the acid and no more pain.  Good product.",

I‚Äôve used Gaviscon for many years and I know what this product is.  But because the label wasn‚Äôt the same I decided to open one to see what was in it. This order is not the real Gaviscon. It doesn‚Äôt foam which is the most important characteristic. It doesn‚Äôt taste as good or the same nor function the same and I advise that you avoid purchasing from this page. I suspect this is nothing but a cheap Chinese knock off.",

For Alka Seltzer chews I was instructed to contact the manufacturer.  Called their hotline but waited on hold for more than 30 minutes with no answer.  Ended up filling out complaint form online but haven't received any notification that they've received my complaint. I like this product a lot and have a subscription to have 200 chews delivered every 4 months, but if this issue isn't resolved I will cancel the subscription and consider alternatives.  I will update my review if the issue is resolved.UPDATE:  About a week went by after submitting my complaint to the manufacturer (Bayer) there was still no communication from a representative, however I finally received an email notification that a FedEx delivery was headed my way.  Waited a couple more days and the package finally arrived only to find that it was a letter instructing me to return the defective product with a prepaid label.  What??  Surely this could have been communicated via email and settled in a much timelier manner.  By this time I had already disposed of the product, but not before taking photos of proof just in case it was needed.  Since I no longer had the physical product, I called the customer support line again, this time being connected to a representative within a few short minutes.  I explained the situation to this person who checked with his manager (I presume) who said emailing the photos should suffice.  I sent an email with the photo attachments and other information (date of purchase, amazon order number, etc.) to the address that he gave me and within 24 hours received an email from another representative stating my refund check would be placed in the mail which I should receive within 10 business days.  Then later that same day I received an email from the representative that I spoke to on the phone, requesting that I email the photos and include information about the Amazon purchase.  I was a bit confused at this point as I had already sent the photos and information as well as informed that a refund check was on its way.  Regardless I obliged and resent the photos and information as requested.  No further communication came from Bayer representatives and I finally received the refund check within the 10 day window.  Since there have been so many other reviewers showing similar problems with broken seals and containers, I have decided it's not worth continuing the subscription on Amazon.  There's no way I want to go through this hassle again.  I'll just go to Walmart and pick up a new bottle when needed.  Upped my overall rating from 3 to 4 stars only because I like using this product. The company (or Amazon) should use a better method for shipping this item.  Perhaps use a box rather than a flimsy bubble wrap envelope.  Cheers!",

The problem with this Alka-Seltzer brand is that it takes several minutes to chew the sugary tablets.  Halfway through chewing they turn into a sticky good that sticks to all my teeth, and impossible to swallow the stuff until I've completely chewed it for a while.  I feel like I'm going to get cavities if I keep using this, with all that sugary goo stuck to my teeth.So I threw this in the trash, a terrible product for this reason.",
