To me, the chewables with the hard-shells that look like big candies are more pleasant to chew and eat.  These are ok though.  A bit chalky but fairly smooth.  They aren't too soft, or too hard.  They are easy to bite into.They make zinc based antacids and they work better, but are more expensive.  My husband won't take anything that even looks like a pill, but he'll take one of these as needed, so I keep a bottle by the bed.They work but sometimes  heartburn might come back a hour or two later.  You can take more, but after all these years I know myself so I just take something stronger.  My husband will usually chew a couple more and get up and go drink milk.  That works for him.",

This is 14$ and lasts just over a month.Dissolving the soda in a cup of water is easy and I drink it down quickly. These are chalky like tums and stick in your teeth, giving you a crappy taste for quite a while.I still give this product 4 stars because it works really well and is easy to carry.

I've been having some acid reflux recently and needed something to quell it. The only reason that I had to give this 4 stars instead of 5 is because there's a slightly strange aftertaste. It's not really a bad taste, but it's weird. However, that being said, it's easy enough to wash down with just water. I'd rather have something with a slightly weird aftertaste that I can get to go away in like 2 seconds than something full of food coloring. I know some people are weird about textures, and this is slightly chalky of a texture when you chew it, but it wasn't enough to bother me. I mean, it is a chewable tablet, what else can you expect? Functionally, it worked wonderfully for me!  There was only one time that I even had to take a second one even though the directions start at 2 tablets. I will definitely buy these again!",

It is cheaper to order it through Whole Foods  but you have to have minimum orders with them too.  A couple of stores near me sell it, but again, often out of stock.

So what justification is there for the 14 dollar price tag? not much. Fortunately I need these so rarely that this one bottle should last several years. Unlikely to order again.",

                "content": "I have all kinds of gut issues and go through a TON of anti-acids, especially Tums and Pepto. I know people complain about the chalky taste of Tums, but I actually like them. I‚Äôve tried several varieties and off-brands and have never had an issue with the taste- until these. I can‚Äôt explain it, but these are really hard for me to choke down. The texture and taste are super unpleasant. I guess if you need dye-free or talc-free Tums, it is good that these exist, but I really can‚Äôt stomach them. I‚Äôve reached for them on a few occasions and I just can‚Äôt do it. Plus, they cost more than their less-natural, but WAY better-tasting competitors.  I wouldn‚Äôt take a risk on these if you haven‚Äôt tried them before- I now have a whole bottle I don‚Äôt know what to do with. :(",

I wish they made plain unsweetened ones...I don't mind bland..in fact I prefer it.",

Turns out that is how it works , it foams up and forms a protective membrane in your stomach to prevent stomach acid from getting into your esophagus.

I mentioned that I occasionally use Tums & he said this was better. The original tastes worse than this cherry flavor but even the cherry flavor taste could be improved. That's why I only gave it 4 stars. As far as the problem of GERD and stuff in my throat, it is much better, especially in the morning which is the worse time for me. I really thought it was from sinus problem but I now can usually distinguish my sinus nose drip from my GERD",

It is the only antacid I've ever used that created a foam when you chew, and wasn't quite sure I liked that.  However, aside from using it once a day as my doctor prescribed, I have also used it when I had heartburn, and this is when I realized the purpose of the foam.  It just seems to settle right on top of the acid and no more pain.  Good product.",

I‚Äôve used Gaviscon for many years and I know what this product is.  But because the label wasn‚Äôt the same I decided to open one to see what was in it. This order is not the real Gaviscon. It doesn‚Äôt foam which is the most important characteristic. It doesn‚Äôt taste as good or the same nor function the same and I advise that you avoid purchasing from this page. I suspect this is nothing but a cheap Chinese knock off.",

For Alka Seltzer chews I was instructed to contact the manufacturer.  Called their hotline but waited on hold for more than 30 minutes with no answer.  Ended up filling out complaint form online but haven't received any notification that they've received my complaint. I like this product a lot and have a subscription to have 200 chews delivered every 4 months, but if this issue isn't resolved I will cancel the subscription and consider alternatives.  I will update my review if the issue is resolved.UPDATE:  About a week went by after submitting my complaint to the manufacturer (Bayer) there was still no communication from a representative, however I finally received an email notification that a FedEx delivery was headed my way.  Waited a couple more days and the package finally arrived only to find that it was a letter instructing me to return the defective product with a prepaid label.  What??  Surely this could have been communicated via email and settled in a much timelier manner.  By this time I had already disposed of the product, but not before taking photos of proof just in case it was needed.  Since I no longer had the physical product, I called the customer support line again, this time being connected to a representative within a few short minutes.  I explained the situation to this person who checked with his manager (I presume) who said emailing the photos should suffice.  I sent an email with the photo attachments and other information (date of purchase, amazon order number, etc.) to the address that he gave me and within 24 hours received an email from another representative stating my refund check would be placed in the mail which I should receive within 10 business days.  Then later that same day I received an email from the representative that I spoke to on the phone, requesting that I email the photos and include information about the Amazon purchase.  I was a bit confused at this point as I had already sent the photos and information as well as informed that a refund check was on its way.  Regardless I obliged and resent the photos and information as requested.  No further communication came from Bayer representatives and I finally received the refund check within the 10 day window.  Since there have been so many other reviewers showing similar problems with broken seals and containers, I have decided it's not worth continuing the subscription on Amazon.  There's no way I want to go through this hassle again.  I'll just go to Walmart and pick up a new bottle when needed.  Upped my overall rating from 3 to 4 stars only because I like using this product. The company (or Amazon) should use a better method for shipping this item.  Perhaps use a box rather than a flimsy bubble wrap envelope.  Cheers!",

The problem with this Alka-Seltzer brand is that it takes several minutes to chew the sugary tablets.  Halfway through chewing they turn into a sticky good that sticks to all my teeth, and impossible to swallow the stuff until I've completely chewed it for a while.  I feel like I'm going to get cavities if I keep using this, with all that sugary goo stuck to my teeth.So I threw this in the trash, a terrible product for this reason.",

The packaging is very cute, and the flavor is even better!

The company has other items as well that they advertise as being better options because of better ingredients.  They come in a large tin container with 120 tablets.

I've taken others in the past that actually make me feel worse so I figure if it does not make me sick when I do not need it them it will certainly not do so when I do.At this time I can say that it tastes fine and it did not make me feel off.  My mom on the other hand, was suffering from some indigestion after eating a few too many sweet and sour shrimp and she took one.  She said it is not something she can chew because the taste and texture were not her favorite.  However, she said if she breaks it into pieces and swallows it as you would aspirin then she's fine with that and that it did in fact ease her discomfort quite quickly.So from 2 people testing this out in the same house: we recommend!  Not to mention $19.99 for 120 tablets is quite a great price!",

It's a must have for me for a number of stomach issuesI also like the packaging. They come in a tin that gives them a unique look. It kind of reminds me of old school packaging from a long time ago",

They are mild and not offensive.  Same chalky taste as other brands, but there's no getting away from that.  They come in a cute reusable metal can screw top can.  But compared to what we usually buy, they are at least twice as expensive, so it's hard to justify the cost for a reorder.",

So I waited to try these or see how effective they were. They have the chew of a typical antacid tablet not chalky just the same consistancy. The flavor is strawberry milkshake but I'm not sure if I'd necessarily call it that. They do have a creamy strawberry flavor and quite good to be honest but it well doesn't remind ME so much of a strawberry milkshake I guess. I took two tablets after I started having issues with the ghost of my taco hotdish kicking in. They worked great on the first dose. So two thumbs up there as with my regular antacid I sometimes find myself taking a second dose or two tablets. I'm happy with these not only how they work but they taste better than the chalky wintergreen flavor or mint flavor of what I typically buy. I tried fruit flavored types but in the past but didn't find them to my liking like these.",

It is a mild taste, although I can still tell it's antacid, it is more tolerable.  This product comes in a tin canister, about 120 tablets, all in strawberry milkshake flavor.  I think the strawberry flavor makes it more tolerable and less like antacid/medicine as opposed to lemon or mint flavors.

I was concerned about the flavor being lemon sorbet because I thought an acidic flavor when you have heartburn already was a terrible idea but honestly its great.  It doesn't taste acidic but rather a nice light lemon burst.  It is quite enjoyable.  You get 3 tablets in each pack of 20 but I have found that only 1 tablet seems to do the job if you are only experience light symptoms.  I will definitely considering reordering these for years to come.  They are a bit pricey though and that would be my main concern.

They typically offer a range of fruity flavors that make them quite palatable, akin to Smarties candy.Enter Wonder Belly Antacid, boasting a formula free from talc, dyes, parabens, and artificial sweeteners. Intrigued by its health-conscious composition, I eagerly tried it, only to find the taste falling short of expectations.Despite my initial excitement for its purported health benefits, the taste of Wonder Belly Antacid left much to be desired. While I value natural ingredients, the flavor didn't quite hit the mark for me. Nonetheless, prioritizing health over taste, I'm inclined to continue consuming it.Additionally, I observed that the product comes in an aluminum bottle, packaged within a small cardboard box. While I appreciate the effort to minimize harmful ingredients, I couldn't help but feel the cardboard packaging was unnecessary and wasteful.In summary, Wonder Belly Antacid presents a health-conscious option for managing acid reflux, but its taste may not appeal to everyone. While I commend its natural formulation, improvements could be made in flavor and packaging efficiency.",

Instructions state to let them sit in the mouth for a few seconds and that makes them easier to chew through. I much prefer the texture of these.I am also allergic to red food coloring and love that these have no food dyes.They also come in an aluminum can. Sticker seal on outside and a foil seal under the cap.One tab helps soothe the heartburn quickly.This strawberry milkshake flavor tastes like a strawberry milkshake, but I prefer the mint version because I miss that cooling sensation with this flavor.I think these are really pricey for regular antacid users because you‚Äôll be going through them rather quickly, but if you are like me and you use them once in a blue moon then they are definitely worth it.To see the photos I attached more clearly, while on a computer right click and select ‚ÄòOpen image in new tab‚Äô for the full sized image.",

They are upfront about the fact the active ingredient is exactly the same as in many other antacid tablets. I used these and they work the same as the big name products, but I'm pretty sure if you frequently consume antacids, you are not going to shell out 4 times more per tablet than, say, Tums Naturals, which have the same amount of calcium carbonate and check off a couple of the same sales points as this product.They may be worth it if you are sensitive to any unnatural or unnecessary ingredients, like dyes or sweeteners, which some other brands may or may not contain. And they do come in cute aluminum cans, that probably have a greater chance of actually getting recycled than plastic containers. Then again, 180 of these tablets come in 3 containers versus 1 container for the same amount of the name brands (as of this writing, these only seem to be offered in 60 tablet cans).It's up to you.

Determined to give them another chance, I decided to try a completely different product and flavor. Wonderbelly Antacid is free of dyes and talc, which is why I was interested in trying it. However, I was concerned because the product lacked a seal and the anti-tamper sticker was not even attached. Considering the significantly higher price compared to other brands, I believe there should be stricter safety measures in place. Unfortunately, due to these concerns, I don't feel comfortable consuming the product and will have to discard it.",

They have a nice strawberry flavor and quickly remedied my heartburn after eating too much pizza and sauce recently.  I definitely liked the product, but I didn't see any significant benefits of these antacids over TUMS or similar products.  There's nothing to justify the 10x price increase.  To me, that's offensive.  ONE STAR!  Sorry, Wonderbelly!  What were you thinking?!",

                "content": "This pack of gas relief tablets arrived quickly and well packaged. The product packaging is clearly labeled to what the contents of the package are. The tin includes 42 chewable simethicone tablets in the Mango Smoothie flavor. A serving size is 1-2 tablets for anyone 12 years old and up, meaning a jar can give you 21-42 servings. This has easily identifiable and limited ingredients that make this a clean option. The tablets taste okay, though don‚Äôt really speak to a mango smoothie flavor. They are easy to chew but I did find that they get caked in my teeth and leave an awkward texture in my mouth. These do help with bloating and gas discomfort, though I can‚Äôt say they are an effective as a pill form. The price point for this is comparable to what I‚Äôve seen it at my local store. Overall, these are a good option for those who don‚Äôt like to take pills or those who have dietary restrictions, but the texture and limited potency does impact whether I would buy this again in the future. Would recommend to specific buyers.",

                "content": "I don‚Äôt like the flavor of these. They taste chalky. There is a little bit of flavoring, but it isn‚Äôt pronounced. These aren‚Äôt sweet, so that‚Äôs a plus if you don‚Äôt like sweet flavors. It‚Äôs like eating a regular calcium supplement that has only been very mildly sweetened. The tablets are very dry and stick to your mouth. You really need water to get these down. The safety seal isn‚Äôt very safe. Instead of a seal that covers the entire inside of the bottle, there is just a single strip of metallic tape that runs down one side of the lid and can. You could easily lift the un-taped side of the can, tamper with the product, and re-seal it to make it look new. I really don‚Äôt like taking medicine this way. I would rather swallow pills than try to chew this dry, chalky, nearly flavorless tablet. Also, at $11.99 for one bottle, they are expensive for simethicone and calcium, which are very common. You can find them all over on Amazon for cheaper.",

                "content": "I have been a fan of Simethicone for years. While I consider the well known brand (G__Ex) to be a staple of our \"first aid\" cabinet, this one works, but does not appeal in the same way to me . That said, here's my longer review with more details:Company Transparency: Trademark Activity for ‚ÄúWonderbelly‚Äù is first noted in 2021. They have a really cute and information dense webpage with an ‚ÄúAbout Us‚Äù that says their Ginger Health company was started by Lucas Kraft (who‚Äôd struggled with gut issues) and his business oriented brother Noah. They ‚Äúput together an amazing team of gastroenterologists and pharmaceutical scientists‚Äù to create products that don‚Äôt  use ingredients like dyes, talc, or artificial sweeteners (note: That doesn't mean \"filler free\"). They provide biographies of their team of three medical advisors!Accountability for Safety: They claim to be  \"clean label project\" certified, vegan, non-GMO, and free of artificial dyes, artificial sweeteners, talc, titanium dioxide, parabens, gluten and dairy. Although most of  Wonderbelly's antacids are verifiably Clean Label Project Certified (checks for things like lead, purity), I don‚Äôt see this product listed at the Clean Label Project webpage (yet?). (In theory the CL Project certification *might*  be as good as GMP certified, even better in a sense, because it tests store bought product that is purchased anonymously, not samples provided by the company. And then they do spot checks periodically. Genius!) (Disclaimer: Just my uneducated opinion about the value of the testing).Quality: Unfortunately the unique safety seal on this is easily tampered with. I can lift it and replace it so that it looks like it did originally. Otherwise, this container includes 42 chewable simethicone tablets that each contain 125 mg of Simethicone, which is the same amount as Gas-Ex Extra strength. They recommend taking 1-3 tablets with symptoms. They have a strong vanilla/strawberry scent, and taste the same (not personally a fan).  They don't dissolve quickly as I chew, but are dry and become a damp clump that sticks to my teeth. The ingredients are said to be ‚ÄúClean‚Äù.  They seem to work for me, bringing quick relief (simethicone is great).I was happy to see other folks enjoyed these, because although I love strawberry shortcake, these just didn't do it for me. They stuck to and filled in the crevices of my molars so that the taste lingered for a long time (I have lots of dental work, so maybe that's the issue?), but I love the \"Clean Label project\" quality verification idea and that some of Wonderbelly's products can be verified in that program!",

I don‚Äôt know why the flavor name ‚Äúmango smoothie‚Äù made me think they would be less chalky. The flavor is mildly artificial mango but not very sweet. I think that‚Äôs good as the flavor fades quickly after eating them, because when your stomach is upset, the last thing you want is a lingering taste. We will see how they work when I really need them!",

I do like that they do not have talc in them nor any dyes. Some of the tablets were broken but I actually liked that because If I just had small discomfort that day I just took a tiny piece. These do work to an extent, but if you have severe gas, you might need more than one. The jar is metal which I really loved because it was easy to take with me because I did not have to worry about them spilling out since they have a screw cap. I will say I did not care of the mango smoothie flavor, it tastes odd. It probably has to do with the 'natural flavors' in the ingredients list. I do like these but would love just a mint flavor.",
